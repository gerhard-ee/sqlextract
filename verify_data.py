verify_data.py - Script to verify data integrity and distribution in sales_transactions table

This script runs a series of SQL queries against the test_db.duckdb database to check:
1. Duplicate transaction_ids (should be 0 due to PRIMARY KEY constraint)
2. Value ranges and basic statistics for all columns
3. Product distribution statistics

Usage:
